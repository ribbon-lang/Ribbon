This is a compiler implementation for the Ribbon programming language. This
project is still in the very early development stages. For now, issues are
turned off and pull requests without prior [discussion](#discussion) are
discouraged.

## What is Ribbon?

Ribbon aims to strike a new balance between high level programmer experience and
low level systems access. It is an algebraic effects language in the lineage of
[Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/) and [Effekt](https://effekt-lang.org/), but
with some adapted influences from the imperative world inspired by a history in game
development, particularly in its focus on performance and allocation, and the
capability to be embedded into other applications.
Semantically, Ribbon has a focus on (fully inferred) strong
and static data types, structural data polymorphism, and allocator strategies.
The design is also motivated by a pursuit of deep extensibility in the style of
[Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) and
[Terra](https://terralang.org/).

The compiler created here will target bytecode for
[Ribbon<sup>I</sup>](https://github.com/ribbon-lang/ribboni), an effect-aware
low level stack machine interpreter (which is in a very early stage of
development) with JIT capabilities. Eventually, the two will be merged into a
single unified system, and AOT native compilation will be supported as well.

## Roadmap

+ âœ… Lisp interpreter (95%)
+ âœ… Lisp environment (95%)
+ âœ… REPL (95%)
+ âœ… CLI (95%)
+ ðŸŸ¥ Type inference (0% here, but [well prototyped](https://github.com/noxabellus/monoidal-rows))
+ ðŸŸ¥ Bytecode generation (0%)
+ ðŸŸ¥ ML-like syntax via lisp reader macros (0%)

The compiler is undergoing heavy development, but there will be test releases
available for most platforms soon. The release will consist of a c header file,
a static library, and a REPL/CLI application. Features implemented thus far
constitute a lisp interpreter with an effects system and a fairly complete
standard library environment.

#### Todo for v0.0.0 release:
+ Finish integrating existing global environments with the new module system
+ Comment syntax
+ Support reader macros
+ Ensure a minimum REPL functionality in Windows terminals
+ Wrap more API with C bindings
+ More testing & clean up


## Discussion

Eventually I will create some places for public discourse about the language,
for now you can reach me via:
- Email: noxabellus@gmail.com
- Discord DM, or on various dev servers: my username is `noxabellus`


## Usage

### Building from source
You will need [`zig`](https://ziglang.org/); likely, the nightly build.
The latest version known to work is `<!--#Readme:Build zig-version-->`.

You can either:
+ Get it through [ZVM](https://www.zvm.app/) or [Zigup](https://marler8997.github.io/zigup/) (Recommended)
+ [Download it directly](https://ziglang.org/download)
+ Get the nightly build through a script like [night.zig](https://github.com/jsomedon/night.zig/)

#### Zig Build Commands
There are several commands available for `zig build` that can be run in usual fashion (i.e. `zig build run`):
<!--#Readme:Build commands-->

Running `zig build` alone will build with the designated or default target and optimization levels.

See `zig build --help` for more information.

#### Zig Build Options
In addition to typical zig build options, the build script supports the following options (though not all apply to every step):
<!--#Readme:Build options-->

See `zig build --help` for more information.


### CLI

The `ribbonc` executable is a work in progress, but offers a functional command line interface for Ribbon.

#### CLI Usage
<!--#Readme:CLI usage-->

#### CLI Options
<!--#Readme:CLI options-->


### REPL

The `ribbonc` executable is a work in progress, but offers a functional REPL interface for Ribbon.

See [CLI](#cli) for information on how to access the REPL mode.

#### REPL Commands
<!--#Readme:CLI commands-->


### Inclusion as a library

#### From Zig

1. Include ribbon in your `build.zig.zon` in the `.dependencies` section,
   either by linking the tar, `zig fetch`, or provide a local path to the source.
2. Add ribbon to your module imports like this:
```zig
const ribbon_c = b.dependency("ribbon-c", .{
    // these should always be passed to ensure ribbon is built correctly
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,

    // additional options can be passed here, these are the same as the build options
    // i.e.
    // .logLevel = .info,
});
module.addImport("RibbonC", ribbon_c.module("Core"));
```
3. See [`src/bin/ribbonc.zig`](src/bin/ribbonc.zig) for usage

#### From C

Should be straight forward, though the API is limited as of now.
Use the included header file, then link your program with the `.lib`/`.a` file.

Example of binding from C can be found at [`tests/test.c`](tests/test.c),
and at [`tests/test.sh`](tests/test.sh)

#### From other languages

If your host language has C FFI, it should be fairly straight forward.
If you make a binding for another language,
please [let me know](#discussion) and I will link it here.


## Lisp dialect

Mostly the same as other lisps, major differences as of now include:
+ No comments yet
+ Only decimal integer literals are supported as of now
+ Character literals are c-style (i.e. `'c'`, `'\x00'` etc)
+ Quasiquotes do not traverse through regular quotes; this is used to allow nested quasi logic
+ Some naming convention differences (e.g. `out<-in` conversion function names)
+ Minimal environment

### Syntax

- Nil `()`
- Symbols `foo`, `foo'`, `/`, `+inf`
- Integers `1001`, `+9`, `-32`
- Characters `'x'`, `'\x00'`, `'\esc'`, `'\t'`, `'\''`
- Floats `1.0`, `1.`, `.0`, `+1.0e-3`
- Strings `"foo"`, `"\tfoo\x00"`, `"\""`
- Pairs `(1 . 2)`, `(1 2 3 . 4)`
- Lists `(1 2 3)`, `(+ 1 2 3)`
- Quotes `'foo`, `'(1 2 3)`
- Quasiquotes
    ```
    `foo
    `(1 2 3)
    ```
- Unquote
    ```
    `(1 ,foo 3)
    ```
- Unquote splicing
    ```
    `(1 2 ,@foo)
    ```

### Environment
