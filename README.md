## What is Ribbon?

Ribbon aims to strike a new balance between high level programmer experience and
low level systems access. It is an algebraic effects language in the lineage of
[Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/) and [Effekt](https://effekt-lang.org/), but
with some adapted influences from the imperative world inspired by a history in game
development, particularly in its focus on performance and allocation, and the
capability to be embedded into other applications.
Semantically, Ribbon has a focus on (fully inferred) strong
and static data types, structural data polymorphism, and allocator strategies.
The design is also motivated by a pursuit of deep extensibility in the style of
[Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) and
[Terra](https://terralang.org/).

The compiler created here will target bytecode for
[Ribbon<sup>I</sup>](https://github.com/ribbon-lang/ribboni), an effect-aware
low level stack machine interpreter (which is in a very early stage of
development) with JIT capabilities. Eventually, the two will be merged into a
single unified system, and AOT native compilation will be supported as well.

## Roadmap

+ âœ… Lisp interpreter (95%)
+ âœ… Lisp environment (95%)
+ âœ… REPL (95%)
+ âœ… CLI (95%)
+ ðŸŸ¥ Type inference (0% here, but [well prototyped](https://github.com/noxabellus/monoidal-rows))
+ ðŸŸ¥ Bytecode generation (0%)
+ ðŸŸ¥ ML-like syntax via lisp reader macros (0%)

The compiler is undergoing heavy development, but there will be test releases
available for most platforms soon. The release will consist of a c header file,
a static library, and a REPL/CLI application. Features implemented thus far
constitute a lisp interpreter with an effects system and a fairly complete
standard library environment.

#### Todo for v0.0.0 release:
+ Finish integrating existing global environments with the new module system
+ Comment syntax
+ Support reader macros
+ Ensure a minimum REPL functionality in Windows terminals
+ Wrap more API with C bindings
+ More testing & clean up


## Discussion

Eventually I will create some places for public discourse about the language,
for now you can reach me via:
- Email: noxabellus@gmail.com
- Discord DM, or on various dev servers: my username is `noxabellus`


## Usage

### Building from source
You will need [`zig`](https://ziglang.org/); likely, the nightly build.
The latest version known to work is `0.14.0-dev.1417+242d268a0`.

You can either:
+ Get it through [ZVM](https://www.zvm.app/) or [Zigup](https://marler8997.github.io/zigup/) (Recommended)
+ [Download it directly](https://ziglang.org/download)
+ Get the nightly build through a script like [night.zig](https://github.com/jsomedon/night.zig/)

#### Zig Build Commands
There are several commands available for `zig build` that can be run in usual fashion (i.e. `zig build run`):
| Command | Description |
|-|-|
|`run`| Build and run a quick debug test version of ribbonc only (No headers, readme, lib ...) |
|`quick`| Build a quick debug test version of ribbonc only (No headers, readme, lib ...) |
|`full`| Runs the following commands: test, readme, header |
|`verify`| Runs the following commands: verify-readme, verify-header, verify-tests |
|`release`| Build the release versions of RibbonC for all targets |
|`unit-tests`| Run unit tests |
|`cli-tests`| Run cli tests |
|`c-tests`| Run C tests |
|`test`| Runs the following commands: unit-tests, cli-tests, c-tests |
|`readme`| Generate `./README.md` |
|`header`| Generate `./include/ribbonc.h` |
|`verify-readme`| Verify that `./README.md` is up to date |
|`verify-header`| Verify that `./include/ribbonc.h` is up to date |
|`verify-tests`| Verify that all tests pass (this is an alias for `test`) |


Running `zig build` alone will build with the designated or default target and optimization levels.

See `zig build --help` for more information.

#### Zig Build Options
In addition to typical zig build options, the build script supports the following options (though not all apply to every step):
| Option | Description | Default |
|-|-|-|
|`-DlogLevel=<log.Level>`| Logging output level to display |`.err`|
|`-DlogScopes=<string>`| Logging scopes to display |`ribbonc,repl`|
|`-DuseEmoji=<bool>`| Use emoji in the output |`true`|
|`-DuseAnsiStyles=<bool>`| Use ANSI styles in the output |`true`|
|`-DreplDumpStdIn=<bool>`| (REPL) Default setting for dumping stdin to a file |`false`|
|`-DreplHistoryPath=<string>`| (REPL) Default path to the history file |`.ribbonc-repl-history`|
|`-DmaxComptimeDepth=<usize>`| (Compiler Eval) Default maximum call depth |`1024`|
|`-DforceNewSnapshot=<bool>`| (Tests) Force a new snapshot to be created instead of referring to an existing one |`false`|
|`-DstripDebugInfo=<?bool>`| Override for optimization-specific settings for stripping debug info from the binary |`{ 110, 117, 108, 108 }`|


See `zig build --help` for more information.

|`Ctrl`+`C`| Cancel current line input |


### Inclusion as a library

#### From Zig

1. Include ribbon in your `build.zig.zon` in the `.dependencies` section,
   either by linking the tar, `zig fetch`, or provide a local path to the source.
2. Add ribbon to your module imports like this:
```zig
const ribbon_c = b.dependency("ribbon-c", .{
    // these should always be passed to ensure ribbon is built correctly
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,

    // additional options can be passed here, these are the same as the build options
    // i.e.
    // .logLevel = .info,
});
module.addImport("RibbonC", ribbon_c.module("Core"));
```
3. See [`src/bin/ribbonc.zig`](src/bin/ribbonc.zig) for usage

#### From C

Should be straight forward, though the API is limited as of now.
Use the included header file, then link your program with the `.lib`/`.a` file.

Example of binding from C can be found at [`tests/test.c`](tests/test.c),
and at [`tests/test.sh`](tests/test.sh)

#### From other languages

If your host language has C FFI, it should be fairly straight forward.
If you make a binding for another language,
please [let me know](#discussion) and I will link it here.


## Lisp dialect

Mostly the same as other lisps, major differences as of now include:
+ No comments yet
+ Only decimal integer literals are supported as of now
+ Character literals are c-style (i.e. `'c'`, `'\x00'` etc)
+ Quasiquotes do not traverse through regular quotes; this is used to allow nested quasi logic
+ Some naming convention differences (e.g. `out<-in` conversion function names)
+ Minimal environment

### Syntax

- Nil `()`
- Symbols `foo`, `foo'`, `/`, `+inf`
- Integers `1001`, `+9`, `-32`
- Characters `'x'`, `'\x00'`, `'\esc'`, `'\t'`, `'\''`
- Floats `1.0`, `1.`, `.0`, `+1.0e-3`
- Strings `"foo"`, `"\tfoo\x00"`, `"\""`
- Pairs `(1 . 2)`, `(1 2 3 . 4)`
- Lists `(1 2 3)`, `(+ 1 2 3)`
- Quotes `'foo`, `'(1 2 3)`
- Quasiquotes
    ```
    `foo
    `(1 2 3)
    ```
- Unquote
    ```
    `(1 ,foo 3)
    ```
- Unquote splicing
    ```
    `(1 2 ,@foo)
    ```

### Environment

#### AList

This module contains functions for creating and manipulating association lists.

| Symbol | Description |
|-|-|
|`alist-pair`| lookup a key symbol in an association list, returning the pair it binds; prompts `fail` if the key is not found |
|`alist-lookup`| lookup a key symbol in an association list, returning its associated value; prompts `fail` if the key is not found |
|`alist-member?`| check if a key symbol is present in an association list |
|`alist-put`| append a key-value pair to an association list |
|`alist-set!`| set the value of an existing key-value pair in an association list, returning the old value; prompts `fail` if the key is not found |
|`alist-each`| calls a function with each key-value pair in an association list |
|`alist-keys`| get the keys of a given association list |

#### Arithmetic

This module provides basic arithmetic functions, constants, and predicates.

| Symbol | Description |
|-|-|
|`add`, `+`| integer/floating point addition on any number of values |
|`sub`, `-`| integer/floating point subtraction on any number of values |
|`mul`, `*`| integer/floating point multiplication on any number of values |
|`div`, `/`| integer/floating point division on any number of values |

|`ceil`| round a floating point number up |
|`round`| round a floating point number |
|`frac`| take the fractional part of a floating point number |

#### Binding

This module provides special forms for defining and manipulating
bindings in the current environment.

`let` creates a new environment frame with the given bindings,
and evaluates the body in that frame.
> ##### Example
> ```lisp
> (let ((var x (+ 1 1))
>       (fun f (x) (+ x 1))
>       (macro m (x) `(f ,x)))
>   (action1 x)
>   (action2 (f x))
>   (action3 (m x)))
> ```

`def-var`, `def-fun`, and `def-macro` forms mirror the syntax of `let`,
but bind individual symbols in the current environment.
> ##### Example
> ```lisp
> (def-var x (+ 1 1))
> (action x)
> ```

`bound?` and `set!` can be used to query and manipulate
bindings created with any of the above forms.

| Symbol | Description |
|-|-|
|`def-var`| define a new variable |
|`def-fun`| define a new function |
|`def-macro`| define a new macro function |
|`let`| create local value bindings |
|`bound?`| check if a given symbol is bound in the current env |
|`set!`| set the value of a symbol in the current env. symbol must already be bound. returns old value |

#### ControlFlow

This module provides special forms for controlling the flow of execution.

`if` is a one or two option conditional branch.
> ##### Example
> ```lisp
> (if x (conditional-action))
> (if y (conditional-action) (else-action))
> ```

`cond` is a multi-option conditional branch.
> ##### Example
> ```lisp
> (cond
>   (x (conditional-action1))
>   (y (conditional-action2))
>   (else (default-action)))
> ```

`match` uses lambda lists to perform structural pattern matching on an input.
> ##### Example
> ```lisp
> (match x
>   ((0) (conditional-action0))
>   ((x) (conditional-action1 x))
>   ((x y) (conditional-action2 x y))
>   ((x y . z) (conditional-action3 x y z))
>   (else (default-action)))
> ```
For more information on the syntax of lambda lists, see the [`LambdaList` module](#lambdalist).

`begin` allows for sequencing expressions.
> ##### Example
> ```lisp
> (begin
>   (action1)
>   (action2))
> ```
| Symbol | Description |
|-|-|
|`if`| two-option conditional branch |
|`when`| single-option conditional branch, taken if the condition is true |
|`unless`| single-option conditional branch, taken if the condition is false |
|`cond`| multi-option conditional branch |
|`match`| lambda list based matching on any inputt |
|`begin`| allows sequencing expressions |
|`panic`| runs `format` on the values provided and then triggers a panic with the resulting string |
|`panic-at`| uses the first argument as the source attribution for the panic; runs `format` on subsequent values provided and then triggers a panic with the resulting string |
|`throw`| prompts `exception` with the value provided; this is a shortcut for `(prompt exception arg)` |
|`stop`| prompts `fail`; this is a shortcut for `(prompt fail)` |
|`assert`| asserts that a condition is true; if it is not, triggers a panic with the subsequent arguments, or with the condition itself if none were provided |
|`assert-eq`| asserts that the first two values provided are equal, using structural equality on objects; if they are not, triggers a panic with any subsequent values provided, or with the condition if none were |
|`assert-eq-addr`| asserts that the first two values provided are equal, using address equality on objects; if they are not, triggers a panic with any subsequent values provided, or with the condition if none were |
|`assert-at`| asserts that a condition is true; if it is not, triggers a panic with the subsequent arguments, or with the condition itself if none were provided |
|`assert-eq-at`| asserts that the first two values provided are equal, using structural equality on objects; if they are not, triggers a panic with any subsequent values provided, or with the equality inputs if none were |
|`assert-eq-addr-at`| asserts, using the location provided as the first argument, that the next two values provided are equal, using address equality on objects; if they are not, triggers a panic with any subsequent values provided, or with the equality inputs if none were |
|`e-assert`| asserts that a condition is true; if it is not, prompts `exception` with the second value provided or with the symbol `AssertionFailed` if one is not |
|`e-assert-eq`| asserts that the first two values provided are equal, using structural equality on objects; if they are not, prompts `exception` with any subsequent values provided, or with the condition if none were |
|`e-assert-eq-addr`| asserts that the first two values provided are equal, using address equality on objects; if they are not, prompts `exception` with any subsequent values provided, or with the condition if none were |
|`f-assert`| asserts that a condition is true; if it is not, prompts `fail` |
|`f-assert-eq`| asserts that the two values provided are equal, using structural equality on objects; if they are not, prompts `fail` |
|`f-assert-eq-addr`| asserts that the two values provided are equal, using address equality on objects; if they are not, prompts `fail` |

#### Conversion

This module provides functions for converting between specific types,
as well as converting between arbitrary values and strings.

| Symbol | Description |
|-|-|
|`bool<-int`| convert an integer to a boolean |
|`int<-bool`| convert a boolean to an integer |
|`int<-char`| convert a character to an integer |
|`char<-int`| convert an integer to a character |
|`int<-float`| convert a float to an integer |
|`float<-int`| convert an integer to a float |
|`string<-symbol`| convert a symbol to a string |
|`symbol<-string`| convert a string to a symbol |
|`stringify`| convert any value to a string representation; optionally accepts two parameters where the first may be a symbol of the set `Display`, `Attr`, `Dotted`, or `Source`, indicating the way in which to format the second value |
|`unstringify`| convert a string representation to a value |

#### Effect

This module provides an api to trigger and handle
arbitrary user-defined side effects at compile time.
The special forms `with` and `with-global` provide a `let`-like syntax for binding
functions, macros, and variables to symbols in a special dynamic environment,
which can be accessed with the `fetch` and `prompt` special forms.

The three kinds of bindings are discriminated
by a keyword at the head of the binding:
> ```lisp
> (with ((kind name def)...) body...)
> (with-global (kind name def)...)
> ```
> Where `kind` is one of:
> + `fun` for lambda-like effect handlers
> + `macro` for macro-like effect handlers
> + `var` for simple variable bindings

Values created via `with` and `with-global` are provided a special binding, `terminate`,
which can be called to cancel the inner computation of
the `with` they are bound to, and return a value in its place.
> [!Caution]
> In the case of terminate being called from a `with-global` binding,
> the computation being terminated is the entire compilation.

> [!Caution]
> Macros calling `terminate` will need to manually evaluate
> their termination value if it requires it;
> all termination values are passed as-is

> ##### Example
> ```lisp
> (with ((fun abort (x) (terminate x))
>        (macro error (x) (prompt abort (eval x)))
>        (var abort2 terminate))
>   (action1)
>   (action2))
> ```

Some builtin effects can also be handled via `with`/`with-global`;
for example `exception` and `fail`, which are triggered by some builtins.

Items bound this way can be accessed with `prompt` and `fetch`:
+ `fetch` simply retrieves the value
+ `prompt` retrieves and then invokes the value with a given list of arguments

| Symbol | Description |
|-|-|
|`with-global`| provide one or more named *top-level* effect handlers to serve as a last resort; note that the `terminate` which is provided to handlers bound this way will terminate compilation |
|`with`| provide one or more named effect handlers, and an expression to execute under them |
|`fetch`| get a dynamically bound variable or effect handler from its binding symbol |
|`prompt`| defer execution to a named effect handler; `(prompt sym args...)` is equivalent to `((fetch sym) args...)` |

#### IO

This module provides functions for interacting with the file system.
Many of these will likely be converted to prompts in the future.

Also available here are the std-io constants `std-in`, `std-out`, and `std-err`,
which refer to file descriptors usable by `read-file`, `write-file` and their related functions.

| Symbol | Description |
|-|-|
|`open-file`| open a file at the provided path; accepts mode symbol `'r`, `'w`, or `'rw`; prompts an exception if it fails |
|`read-file`| read the content of a text file to a string; if a second parameter is given it is expected to be the length in bytes to read, otherwise reads the whole file; prompts an exception if it fails |
|`read-ln`| read a single line of a text file to a string; prompts an exception if it fails |
|`write-file`| write a string to a file; prompts an exception if it fails |
|`write-ln`| write an optional string to a file, then write a new line; prompts an exception if it fails |
|`print`| stringify all* arguments with `'Display`, concatenate, then `write-file` with the resulting string; if the first parameter is a file, prints to that file instead of std-out; prompts an exception if it fails |
|`print-ln`| stringify all* arguments with `'Display`, concatenate, then `write-ln` with the resulting string; if the first parameter is a file, prints to that file instead of std-out; prompts an exception if it fails |
|`file-end`| get the cursor position that marks the end of a file; prompts an exception if it fails |
|`file-cursor`| get the current cursor position in a file; prompts an exception if it fails |
|`file-cursor!`| set the current cursor position in a file; prompts an exception if it fails |
|`std-in`| the input file constant |
|`std-out`| the output file constant |
|`std-err`| the error file constant |

#### LambdaList

##### Supported lambda list syntax
- `optional` = `(? var)`
    > if there are arguments remaining, apply `var` to the next argument; otherwise any bindings within `var` are `nil`
- `rest` = `(... symbol)`
    > if there are arguments remaining, bind the rest of the arguments to `symbol`; otherwise bind `nil`
- `cons` = `. var`
    > if there are arguments remaining, bind the rest of the arguments to `var`; otherwise bind `nil`
- `var` =
    + `(var* optional* rest? cons?)`
        > expect a list of `var`s, or the empty list
    + `,expr`
        > same as quasiquote's unquote, evaluate `expr` and apply it to the next argument
    + `(@ symbol var)`
        > match the given `var`, then bind it to the given `symbol` (ie `(@ foo 1)` matches the number `1` and binds it to `foo`)
    + `(: predicate)`
        > expect a value that satisfies the given `predicate`
    + `(-> translator-function var*)`
        > apply the given `translator-function` to the argument, and bind the results to the given `var`s if any are present;
        > translator function can `(prompt fail)` to reject the match
    + `symbol`
        > bind any value to the given `symbol`
    + `'symbol`
        > expect a literal `symbol`
    + expect an exact match to the given atom:
        * `int` (ie `1`, `9900`, etc)
        * `float` (ie `1.`, `3.14e-2`, etc)
        * `char` (ie `'a'`, `'\n'`, etc)
        * `string` (ie `"hello"`, `"\x00\""`, etc)
        * `bool` (ie `true`, `false`)

Additionally, repeated binding symbols (ie `(a a)`) are allowed, and will have their bound values checked for equality with `eq?`

> ##### Example
> ```lisp
> (assert-eq
>     (run-lambda-list (a b) '(1 2))
>     '((b . 2) (a . 1)))

>         2))
>
> (assert-eq 'okay
>     (with ((fun fail () (terminate 'okay)))
>         (f-lambda-list
>             (-> (lambda (x) (f-assert-eq x 1) (list x)) a)
>             2)))
>
> (assert-eq '((x . (1 . 2)))
>     (run-lambda-list
>         (@ x (: pair?))
>         '(1 . 2)))
>
> (assert-eq 'okay
>     (with ((fun fail () (terminate 'okay)))
>         (f-lambda-list
>             (@ x (: pair?))
>             1)))
> ```

#### Procedure

This module provides the primitive `lambda` and `macro` special forms,
which can be used anywhere to create closure-binding procedural abstractions.

The only difference between `lambda` and `macro` is the timing of evaluation:
+ `lambda` evaluates its arguments at the time of invocation,
  and evaluates its return value in its own environment.
+ `macro` does not evaluate its arguments,
  and evaluates its return value in the environment of the caller.

> ##### Example
> ```lisp
> (lambda (x y) (+ x y))
> ```
> ```lisp
> (macro (x y) `(+ ,x ,y))
> ```
| Symbol | Description |
|-|-|
|`lambda`| inline function definition |
|`macro`| inline macro definition |
|`apply`| apply a function to a list of arguments |

#### Source

This module provides functions for the creation, access and transformation
of source-attribution primitives.

| Symbol | Description |
|-|-|
|`attr-here`| create a source attribution referencing the call location |
|`attr-filename`| get the filename stored in an Attr |
|`attr-range`| get the range stored in an Attr |
|`attr-new`| create a new Attr from a filename string and a range object |
|`attr-of`| extract the Attr from a value |
|`attr-set!`| set the Attr of a value; returns the old Attr |

#### String

This module provides functions for working with strings,
as well as conversions between strings and lists of chars.

The functions in this module are designed to be utf8-safe, and will
generally cause a compilation error if used improperly.

Most functions come in a codepoint-indexed and byte-index variant.

> [!Caution]
> Special care must be take in particular with the byte-indexed
> functions to avoid causing errors, as they validate that their operation is
> boundary-aligned.
