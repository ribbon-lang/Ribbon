---

This is a combined repo for the Ribbon programming language, containing various components of the compiler, driver, runtime, and common utilities.

This project is still in the very early development stages. For now, issues are
turned off and pull requests without prior discussion are discouraged.


## Discussion

Eventually I will create some places for public discourse about the language,
for now you can reach me via:
- Email: noxabellus@gmail.com
- Discord DM, or on various dev servers: my username is `noxabellus`


## References

We truly stand on the shoulders of giants and I'm afraid listing everything I've
referenced in the design of this language would be impossible, so the following
are some highlights I found particularly well-written, informative, or otherwise
inspiring
